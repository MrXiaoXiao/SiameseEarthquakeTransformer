# SiameseEarthquakeTransformer

## UNDER CONSTRUCTION. The code cleaning and the tutorial update will be finished before 05.08.2021.
A tutorial and updated codes for research paper: ‘Siamese Earthquake Transformer: A pair-input deep-learning model for earthquake detection and phase picking on a seismic array.’

## Brief Introduction:
Siamese Earthquake Transformer (S-EqT) is developed based on the Earthquake Transformer (EqT) (Mousavi et al., 2020, Nature Communications) (https://github.com/smousavi05/EQTransformer), which is an excellent method and a strong baseline for earthquake detection and phase picking. The primary purpose of the S-EqT model is to reduce the false-negative rate of the EqT model by leveraging latent information in the pre-trained EqT model and retrieving previously missed phase picks in low SNR seismograms based on their similarities with other confident phase picks in high-dimensional spaces.
